# README

RateMyFav is an app that lets you submit and vote on your favorite franchises.

This is the Rails-only version of RateMyFav. No Javascript is used for asynchronous GET/POST requests. Instead, all API interactions are written with RESTful and custom Rails routes to demonstrate an understanding of standard Rails routing.

# Installation Instructions

Clone the repo, navigate into it, and run `rails s` to start the local Rails server. The app should open in your web browser automatically.
